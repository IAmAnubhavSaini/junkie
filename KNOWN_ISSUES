* Howto compile on Debian Lenny

To compile the master branch of Junkie from a fresh git clone on Debian Lenny,
you must install from backports-lenny the packages autoconf, libtool and
libltdl-dev.

A more recent version than 0.9 of Libpcap should probably be installed from
sources ; or the packages libpcap0.8 and libpcap0.8-dev can also be taken from
the squeeze distribution, as by chance they install fine on a lenny.

For guile, the guile available in lenny has been compiled without thread
support, which may or not be a problem depending on what you are planning to
use Junkie for.

Then proceed with autogen.sh.
