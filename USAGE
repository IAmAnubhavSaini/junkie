See Junkie --help for command line arguments.
By itself, Junkie does nothing out of the parsed packets. In order to be
usefull you thus have to load a plugin. For instance, the basic dumper
plugin included in junkie distribution will display all gathered informations:

junkie -i eth0 -p dumper.so

Other plugins may be available to perform other less basic functionnalities,
such as network related measurments of load, response times, security
monitoring, etc... Or you can write those plugins yourself !

Out of the box, junkie can also be used as an SNMP subagent, provided the
snmp-subagt.scm configuration file is loaded (and an agentX snmp daemon is
accepting connections localy). The implemented MIBS are located in the
config subdirectory.
